        <h1>Music: My Passion</h1>
    </div>
    <p>One of my great passions in life is music. I love listening to, playing, and creating music! Here's some more about my music preferences and experiences!</p>

    <div class="h2">
    <h2>How It All Started</h2>
    </div>
    <p>When I was young, I loved listening to music. Back then, my favorite artist was Owl City. I loved the electronic, catchy vibe of all his songs. When I found out it was one person that made all of Owl City's music, a seed was planted in my heart. Deep down, I wanted to be like that. I wanted to make music that other people loved just as much as I loved Owl City's Music. As I grew up, I learned a lot of instruments, but my favorite was the piano. I started writing songs on the piano and singing along to them. Then, in high school, I started creating tracks and mixing songs so they sounded more professional. To this day, I love creating music that expresses my emotions in a creative way.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned before, I love writing music. Now that you know about some of the artist I like listening to, let me tell you about some of the songs I've written!</p>

    <div class="h2"><h2>Music I Have Written</h2></div>
    <p>I currently have three songs on streaming services.</p>
    
    <div class="h3"><h3>A Boy Called Hope (Glimmers In The Night)</h3></div>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>This is the story of a boy who was different from what was "cool" or "normal" in the world. There's a lot of parallels between this boy and our Savior, Jesus Christ. I wanted to make a song about meek defiance-- about someone who faced scorn of others and stood his ground because he knew who he was. Thus, "A Boy Called Hope (Glimmers In The Night)" was born.</p>

    <div class="h3"><h3>Too Early</h3></div>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>There's so much I don't know about life. One day, I was thinking about how confusing relationships are. I found myself echoing the statements of doubters: "you can't possibly know who you'll marry by now", "you're too young", "it's too soon"... these comments about things being too early to know repeated in my head. But then I got thinking-- what isn't it too early for? It's not too early to miss her. It's not too early to wish she was here. I don't know everything, but this is a song about what I do know.</p>

    <div class="h3"><h3>'06 Accord</h3></div>
    <div class="exp">
      <p>Nostalgia. This song is all about nostalgia. About a year ago, I bought an '06 Honda Accord from my brother. It is the perfect college car. Peeling hood, dented bumper, blacked out rims-- on the outside, it may look rough. But to me, it means so much. It reminds me of my brother, who I bought it from. It's crazy to see how now I'm in the stage of life he was in when he first bought the car. This connection was one I had to put into music. This was the first song I ever put out on streaming services.</p>
